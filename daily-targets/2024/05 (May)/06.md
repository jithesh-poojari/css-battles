### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#4F77FF`, which is a shade of blue.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document have a background color of `#EFF8FE`, which is a shade of light blue.

- **Positioning (`position: fixed`):** 
  - The `<p>` element represents the stem of the flower. It is styled with a fixed position, specific width, height, margin, color, and box-shadow properties to create the appearance of a stem with reflections.

  - The `<a>` element represents the central circular element of the flower. It is styled with a fixed position, specific height, width, and margin to position it within the viewport.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful use of CSS properties to position, style, and add effects to elements.
