### Code Explanation

- **Global Styles (`*`)**:
  - **Background Color**: The entire background of the page is set to `#EA6B62`, which is a soft pinkish-red color.
  - **Margin and Padding**: Both are set to `0` to remove any default spacing that might affect the layout.

- **Common Styles for `<p>` and `<a>` Tags**:
  - **Position**: Both elements are positioned using `fixed`, meaning they are placed relative to the viewport and stay in a fixed position when scrolling.
  - **Background Color**: Both elements have a background color of `#512B2A`, a dark brownish shade.
  - **Border-radius**: The border-radius is set to `10px`, giving both elements slightly rounded corners.

- **Specific Styles for `<p>` Tag**:
  - **Width and Height**: The width is set to `140px` and the height to `100px`.
  - **Top and Left Positioning**: The element is positioned `80px` from the top and `110px` from the left of the viewport.
  - **Box-shadow**: A shadow is added to the element with a horizontal offset of `140px` and no vertical offset, using the same color as the background. This effectively creates a visual extension to the right of the element, making it appear longer.

- **Specific Styles for `<a>` Tag**:
  - **Width and Height**: The width is set to `120px` and the height to `120px`, making it a square element.
  - **Top and Left Positioning**: The element is positioned `180px` from the top and `130px` from the left of the viewport.

This configuration places two elements on the screen with precise positioning and dimensions, creating a visual layout that matches the target image. The use of `fixed` positioning ensures that the elements stay in place relative to the viewport, and the box-shadow on the `<p>` element gives it an extended appearance.
