  }
</style>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#B53733`, which is a shade of red.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document have a background color of `#EA7457`, which is a shade of orange.

- **Positioning (`margin`, `border-radius`, `outline`, `outline-offset`):** 
  - The `<p>` elements represent the petals of the flower. They are styled with a specific padding, margin, border-radius, background color, outline, and outline-offset properties to create the appearance of petals.

  - The `<a>` element represents the center of the flower. It is styled with a fixed position, specific height, width, margin, and border properties to create the appearance of the flower center.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful use of CSS properties to position, style, and add outline effects to elements.
