### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#FFFFCD`, a light yellow shade.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements inherit a background color of `#E78320`, which is an orange shade. They also have a margin set to create space between them.

- **Positioning (`position: fixed`):** 
  - Both the `<a>` and `<p>` elements are positioned as fixed elements.
  - The `<a>` element represents the center of the flower. It has a padding, border color combination that creates a triangular shape, and it's rotated by 45 degrees. The margin is adjusted to position it properly.
  - The `<p>` element represents the petals of the flower. It has a background color of `#FFFFCD`, padding, and margin to create the petal shape. The `[a]` selector further adjusts the margin for one of the petals.

Overall, the code effectively creates a visually appealing flower composition using CSS properties for styling and positioning elements.
