### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#4F77FF`, which is a shade of blue.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document have a white background color (`#fff`), providing a contrast against the background color.

- **Positioning (`position`, `margin`, `rotate`):** 
  - All elements are positioned as fixed elements to ensure they stay in a fixed position within the viewport. They are given specific padding, border, and margin values to control their size and spacing relative to each other.
  
  - The `<a>` element represents the center of the flower. It is styled with specific margin values to position it in the center of the viewport.
  
  - The `<i>` and `<b>` elements represent the petals of the flower. They are styled with specific padding, border-radius, margin, and background properties to create the appearance of petals. The `<b>` element is rotated by 180 degrees to position it opposite to the `<i>` element.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful use of CSS properties to position, style, and rotate elements.
