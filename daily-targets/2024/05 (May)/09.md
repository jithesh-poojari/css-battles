    box-shadow:140px 0#06487A
  }
</style>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#D5EDFC`, which is a light blue shade.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document inherit a border with a solid color of `#06487A`, which is a dark blue shade. Additionally, they have a border-radius property set to `53q` to create rounded corners, giving them a circular appearance. The second set of elements also have a margin set to create space between them.

- **Positioning (`position: fixed`):** 
  - Both the `<a>` and `<p>` elements are positioned as fixed elements to ensure they stay in a fixed position within the viewport.
  - The `<a>` element represents the center of the flower. It is styled with specific padding and margin to position it within the viewport.
  - The `<p>` element represents the petals of the flower. It is styled with specific padding, background color, border-radius, margin, and box-shadow properties to create the appearance of petals with reflections.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful use of CSS properties to style and position elements.
