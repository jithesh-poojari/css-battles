```html
<p>
<style>
*{
  background:#223E1F;
  +*{
    background:#BFE33A;
    margin:100 50

    box-shadow:40px 0,120px 0,200px 0,240px 0
  }
</style>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#223E1F`, which is a shade of dark green.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document inherit a background color of `#BFE33A`, which is a shade of light green. Additionally, they have a margin set to create space between them.

- **Positioning (`position: fixed`):** 
  - The `<p>` element represents the stem of the flower. It is styled with a fixed position, specific height, width, margin, color, and box-shadow properties to create the appearance of a stem with reflections.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful use of CSS properties to style and position elements.
