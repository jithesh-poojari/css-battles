### Code

```html
<p>
<style>
  *{
    background:#EDAF38;
    >*{
      background:#FFFFCD
    }
    +*{
      border-radius:50q;

  }
</style>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#EDAF38`, which is a shade of yellow.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements inherit a background color of `#FFFFCD`, which is a lighter shade of yellow. Additionally, the second set of elements has a border-radius property set to `50q`, which creates rounded shapes. They also have a margin set to create space between them.

- **Positioning (`position: fixed`):** 
  - All elements are positioned as fixed elements.
  - The elements within the second level of nesting (`>*`) have a border-radius property set to create rounded shapes, and a margin to space them out.

Overall, the code effectively uses CSS properties to create a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with rounded shapes and appropriate positioning of elements.
