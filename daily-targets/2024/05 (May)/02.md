### Stats

**Match**: 100%  
**Score**: 711.53{134}

### Code

```html
<style>
*{
  background:#611B3F;
  +*{
    background:#BE3184;
    margin:69 100 95;
    clip-path:polygon(50%0,22%41%,0%41%,20%100%,80%100%,100%41%,78%41%)
  }
}
</style>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#611B3F`, which is a shade of dark purple.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document have a background color of `#BE3184`, which is a shade of pink. These elements are positioned relative to each other using margins and are clipped using a polygon clip-path to create the shape of flower petals.

- **Positioning (`margin`, `clip-path`):** 
  - The second set of elements (`+*`) represents the petals of the flower. They are styled with specific margin values to position them within the viewport. Additionally, a clip-path polygon is applied to each element to create the shape of flower petals.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful use of CSS properties to position and style elements.
