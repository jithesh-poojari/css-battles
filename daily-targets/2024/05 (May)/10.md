### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#512B2A`, which is a shade of dark brown.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document inherit a background color of `#EA6B62`, which is a shade of red. Additionally, they have a border-radius property set to `20q` to create rounded corners, giving them a circular appearance. The second set of elements also have a margin set to create space between them.

- **Positioning (`position: fixed`):** 
  - All elements are positioned as fixed elements to ensure they stay in a fixed position within the viewport. 
  - The `<a>` element represents the center of the flower. It is styled with specific width, height, border-radius, background color, and margin to position it properly within the viewport.
  - The `<p>` and `<i>` elements represent the petals of the flower. They are styled with specific padding, background color, border-radius, clip-path, margin, and box-shadow properties to create the appearance of petals with reflections.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful use of CSS properties to style and position elements.
