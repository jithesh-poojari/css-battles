### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The `body` background color is set to a dark purple shade (`#504371`), providing a bold and intense backdrop for the shapes.

- **Container (`body`):** The `body` element serves as the container for the shapes. It uses CSS grid to center its contents both horizontally and vertically.

- **Shapes (`p`, `a`):** Two elements contribute to the design:
  - The `<a>` element represents a horizontal bar with a light purple background color (`#A6A0BE`). It has a width of 400 pixels and a height of 30 pixels. This element is positioned absolutely within the container.
  - The `<p>` element represents a square shape with a light purple border. It has a border width of 30 pixels, creating a thick border. The element is rotated 45 degrees using the `rotate` property.

- **Positioning and Layout (`position`, `absolute`):** Both `<p>` and `<a>` elements are positioned absolutely within the container, allowing precise control over their placement.

- **Styling (`background`, `border`, `rotate`):** Each element has specific styling applied to create the desired visual appearance. The border of the `<p>` element creates a diamond-like shape when rotated. The rotation is achieved using the `rotate` property.

Overall, the code creates a visually interesting composition with a rotated diamond shape and a horizontal bar, achieving a near-perfect match and a high score.
