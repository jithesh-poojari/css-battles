### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The `body` background color is set to a light blue shade (`#D5EDFC`), creating a calm and soothing backdrop for the shapes.

- **Shapes (`p`, `a`):** Three elements contribute to the design: two `<p>` elements and one `<a>` element. The first `<p>` element (`[a]`) represents a horizontal rectangle with a light blue background. It is positioned at the top of the container. The `<a>` element represents a vertical rectangle with a slightly darker blue background, positioned below the first rectangle. The second `<p>` element (`[b]`) has no visual impact on the design as its background color matches the background.

- **Positioning (`position`, `absolute`):** Both `<p>` elements and the `<a>` element are absolutely positioned to allow precise control over their placement within the container.

- **Dimensions and Styling (`width`, `height`, `border-radius`, `border`, `box-shadow`):**
  - The first `<p>` element (`[a]`) has a width of 200 pixels, a height of 50 pixels, and a border radius of 90%. It has no border but serves as a decorative element.
  - The `<a>` element has a width of 100 pixels and a height of 200 pixels, creating a vertical rectangle. It has a border with a blue color (`#7791B6`) and a shadow effect applied using `box-shadow`.
  - The second `<p>` element (`[b]`) has no visual impact on the design as its background color matches the background color of the body.

The overall result is a visually dynamic composition with two rectangles against a light blue background, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
