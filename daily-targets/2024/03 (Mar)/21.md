### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The `body` background color is set to a dark purple shade (`#301e53`), providing a solid backdrop for the shapes.

- **Container (`i`):** An `<i>` element serves as the container for the shapes. It is displayed as a flex container with the `display: flex` property, arranging its child elements in a row. The gap between the child elements is set to 10 pixels using the `gap` property. The container is horizontally centered within the viewport with left and right margins of 75 pixels.

- **Shapes (`p`, `a`):** Five elements contribute to the design: three `<p>` elements and two `<a>` elements. Each `<p>` element represents a rectangular shape, while each `<a>` element represents a parallelogram-like shape. The dimensions and background colors are specified for each element to achieve the desired appearance.

- **Positioning and Sizing (`margin`, `width`, `height`):** The child elements of the container (`<p>` and `<a>`) are positioned and sized accordingly to fit within the container and maintain the desired spacing between them.

- **Clipping (`clip-path`):** Both `<a>` elements have a clip-path property applied to create a parallelogram-like shape. The clip-path property defines a polygon shape that clips the element, resulting in the desired visual effect.

Overall, the code creates a visually dynamic composition with rectangular and parallelogram-like shapes arranged in a row, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
