### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The `body` background color is set to a dark blue shade (`#05476C`), providing a deep and bold backdrop for the shapes.

- **Shapes (`p`, `[a]`):** Two `<p>` elements contribute to the design:
  - The first `<p>` element represents a large rectangle with a gradient background. The gradient transitions from a light blue color (`#2BBBF3`) at the top to a darker blue color (`#2BBBF3`) at the bottom. It has a width of 100 pixels, a height of 200 pixels, and rounded top corners achieved using `border-radius`.
  - The second `<p>` element (`[a]`) represents a smaller rectangle inside the large rectangle. It has a solid background color of `#2BBBF3`, matching the top color of the gradient. It is rotated 180 degrees to create a mirror effect, making it appear at the bottom of the large rectangle.

- **Positioning and Layout (`margin`, `display`):** The `<p>` elements are displayed inline-block and positioned vertically using the `margin` property. The second `<p>` element (`[a]`) has a negative top margin to position it below the first `<p>` element.

- **Styling (`border-radius`, `background`, `rotate`):** The first `<p>` element has rounded top corners achieved using `border-radius`. The gradient background is created using the `linear-gradient` function. The second `<p>` element (`[a]`) has a solid background color matching the top color of the gradient. It is rotated 180 degrees to create a mirror effect.

Overall, the code creates a visually appealing composition with rectangular shapes and gradient effects, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
