### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The `body` background color is set to a vibrant blue shade (`#6592CF`), providing a visually appealing backdrop for the shapes.

- **Shapes (`div`, `p`):** Two elements contribute to the design. The `div` element represents a square shape with dimensions 120x120, styled with a border to create a triangle effect. The `p` element forms a rectangle with dimensions 40x170, positioned to align with the bottom edge of the square. Both elements have specific border-radius values to achieve the desired shape.

- **Positioning (`position`, `absolute`):** Both `div` and `p` elements are absolutely positioned, allowing precise control over their placement within the `body`.

- **Border Styling (`border`, `border-radius`):** The `div` element is styled with a thick border of 40px, creating the triangular shape. The `border-radius` property is used to curve the bottom edges of both the `div` and `p` elements, enhancing their appearance.

- **Shadow Effect (`box-shadow`):** The `box-shadow` property is not used in this code. However, it can be implemented to add shadow effects and enhance the visual depth of the design.

The overall result is a visually dynamic composition where squares and rectangles, with carefully applied styling and positioning, form an intricate pattern against the vibrant blue background, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
