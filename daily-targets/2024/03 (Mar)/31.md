### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The `body` background color is set to a dark purple shade (`#512B2A`), providing a bold and intense backdrop for the shapes.

- **Shapes (`p`, `a`):** Two elements contribute to the design:
  - The `<p>` element represents a square shape with a dark red background color (`#EA6B62`). It has a height of 50 pixels and a width of 50 pixels. The element is positioned in the center of the viewport using auto margins, and it has box shadows applied to create a shadow effect.
  - The `<a>` element represents two sets of parallel lines. It has a light red background color matching the `<p>` element and is displayed flexibly to arrange its child elements in a row. Each set of parallel lines is created using two box shadows with appropriate offsets to resemble lines.

- **Positioning and Layout (`margin`, `display`):** The `<p>` element is centered horizontally within the viewport using auto margins. The `<a>` element is displayed flexibly, allowing its child elements to be arranged in a row.

- **Styling (`background`, `color`, `box-shadow`):** Each element has specific styling applied to create the desired visual appearance. The box shadows applied to the `<p>` element create a shadow effect, giving it a three-dimensional appearance. The `<a>` element is styled to resemble parallel lines using box shadows.

Overall, the code creates a visually appealing composition with a square element and parallel lines, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
