<p>
<p a>

<div>
  <style>
    body {
      background: #fad3e5;
      display: grid;

    div {
      width: 20;
      height: 100;
      background:#FAD3E5;
      box-shadow: 0 -110px #8b0051, 0 110px #8b0051;
    }
    p {
      width: 180;
      height: 20;
      border: 20px solid #8b0051;
    }
    [a] {
      margin: -80 0 0;
      width: 100;
    }
    [b] {
      margin: 80 0 0;
      width: 260;
    }
  </style>
```

**Code Explanation:**

- **Background (`body`):** The background color of the entire page is set to a pastel shade (`#FAD3E5`), creating a soft and visually pleasing backdrop.

- **Container (`div`):** A vertical line is formed using a `div` element. The `box-shadow` property is applied to create two shadows, positioned above and below the container, giving the appearance of a vertical line.

- **Triangle (`p`):** The triangular pattern is achieved using two `<p>` elements. The first `<p>` creates the main triangle, appearing as a square with a circular cutout. The `border` property is used to form the triangular shape.

- **Scaling and Positioning (`[a]` and `[b]`):** The `[a]` attribute selector is applied to scale the second `<p>` element down to 50% of its original size and position it above the container. The `[b]` attribute selector scales the third `<p>` element up to 130% of its original size and positions it below the container. This arrangement creates an intriguing triangular pattern.

The overall result is a visually dynamic composition that effectively utilizes squares and lines to form an interesting triangular design against the soft pastel background.
