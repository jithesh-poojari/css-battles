```html
<p>
<p a><p><p b>
<style>
 *{
   background:#223E1F;
   margin:0
 }
  p{
    position:fixed;
    height:300;
    width:90;
    background:#BFE33A;

  [a]{
    rotate:60deg;
    margin:56
  }
  [b]{
    rotate:-60deg;
    margin:55 250
  }
</style>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#223E1F`, which is a dark green shade.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document have a background color of `#223E1F`, matching the background color of the document.

- **Positioning (`position` and `margin`):** All elements are positioned as fixed elements (`position: fixed;`) and have specific margins to position them properly within the viewport.

- **Styling (`border-radius`, `rotate`):** 
  - The `<p>` elements represent the stem and petals of the flower. They are styled with a fixed position, specific height, width, background color, and border radius to create a curved appearance. Additionally, the `[a]` and `[b]` attribute selectors rotate specific petals by 60 degrees and -60 degrees, respectively, and adjust their margins to position them correctly within the flower.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful positioning and styling of elements.
