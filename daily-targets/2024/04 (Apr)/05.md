### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The `body` background color is set to a dark red shade (`#631E1D`), providing a bold and intense backdrop for the shapes.

- **Shapes (`a`, `p`, `i`):** Five elements contribute to the design:
  - Two `<a>` elements represent diagonal bars with a red background color (`#F16B4A`). They are positioned absolutely with a width of 30 pixels and a height of 30 pixels. These elements represent the upper and lower parts of the cross symbol.
  - Two `<p>` elements represent horizontal bars with a red background color (`#F16B4A`). They are also positioned absolutely with a width of 60 pixels and a height of 15 pixels. These elements represent the arms of the cross symbol.
  - One `<i>` element represents a vertical bar with a red background color (`#F16B4A`). It is positioned absolutely with a width of 30 pixels and a height of 30 pixels. This element represents the central part of the cross symbol.

- **Positioning and Layout (`position`, `margin`):** All elements (`<a>`, `<p>`, `<i>`) are positioned absolutely within the container, allowing precise control over their placement. They are positioned to form the shape of a cross.

- **Styling (`background`, `color`, `box-shadow`, `rotate`):** Each element has specific styling applied to create the desired visual appearance. They all have a background color of red (`#F16B4A`). The `<a>` and `<p>` elements have box shadows applied to create the appearance of depth. The `<p>` element is rotated 90 degrees to form the horizontal arms of the cross.

Overall, the code creates a visually appealing composition resembling a cross symbol, achieving a near-perfect match and a high score.
