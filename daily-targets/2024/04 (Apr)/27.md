### Code

```html
<p><p a>
<style>
*{
  background:#81008F
}
  p{
    background:#DBBEDF;
    height:310;
    width:100;
    margin:-10 62;

  }
  [a]{
    margin:-310 222
  }
</style>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#81008F`, which is a dark purple shade.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document have a background color of `#81008F`, matching the background color of the document.

- **Positioning (`position: fixed`):** All elements are positioned as fixed elements to ensure they stay in a fixed position within the viewport.

- **Styling (`clip-path`):** 
  - The `<p>` elements represent the petals of the flower. They are styled with specific height, width, background color, and a clip-path to create a triangular shape resembling a petal. The clip-path polygon is defined to create the triangular shape with rounded corners, giving it a petal-like appearance.

  - The `[a]` attribute selector targets the center of the flower and adjusts its margin to position it properly within the flower.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful positioning and styling of elements.
