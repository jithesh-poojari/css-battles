  }

```

### Code Explanation:

- **Background (`body`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#301E53`, which is a dark purple shade.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document, represented by the wildcard selector `*`, have a background color of `#A6A0BE`, which is a light purple-gray shade.

- **Positioning (`position` and `margin`):** Both the `<p>` (stem) and `<a>` (petal) elements are positioned as fixed elements using `position: fixed;`. They are styled with appropriate padding, margin, and border-radius to achieve the desired shapes and positions within the viewport.

- **Styling (`box-shadow`, `outline`, `outline-offset`, `border-radius`):** The `<p>` element representing the stem of the flower has a padding of `50px` and is styled with a border-radius of `60q` for its bottom corners, giving it a tapered appearance. It also has a box-shadow to create a shadow effect, positioned `220px` to the right. The `<a>` element representing the petal is initially hidden (`<a>`), but when targeted with the attribute selector `[a]`, it becomes visible and is rotated `90deg` to form the shape of the petal. It has a height of `220px`, a width of `40px`, and a border-radius of `40q` for its rounded shape. Additionally, it has two box-shadows to create the illusion of depth and dimension.

- **Coloring:** Both the `<p>` and `<a>` elements have a background color of `#A6A0BE`, which matches the color of the flower petals. 

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with a stem and a petal, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
