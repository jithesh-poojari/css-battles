```

### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#0A6190`, which is a shade of blue.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document inherit a light blue background color (`#EFF8FE`), providing a contrast against the background color.

- **Positioning (`position`, `margin`, `border-radius`):** 
  - The second set of elements (`+*`) has a margin set to position them within the viewport. Additionally, they are styled with a border-radius of `60q` to give them a rounded appearance.

- **Styling of Petals (`p`):** The `<p>` element represents the petals of the flower. It is styled with a fixed position, specific width, height, and a border-radius to give it a rounded shape. Additionally, it has a box-shadow to create a shadow effect.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful use of CSS properties to position and style elements.
