    box-shadow:20px -20px 0 20px,-20px 20px 0 20px
  }
}
</style>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Background (`body`):** The `background` property sets the background color of the HTML document to a dark shade of green (`#223E1F`), providing a contrasting backdrop for the flower.

- **Shapes (`p`, `a`, `b`, `c`):** Four elements are used to create the main shape of the flower. Each element is styled to resemble a petal of the flower. They are positioned absolutely within their container and styled with various background colors and dimensions to achieve the desired visual appearance.

- **Positioning (`position`, `margin`):** The elements are positioned absolutely within their container, allowing precise control over their placement. Margins are adjusted to position the elements correctly within the container.

- **Styling (`background`, `box-shadow`, `rotate`):** Each element has specific styling applied to create the desired visual appearance. The elements are styled with different background colors to resemble the petals of a flower. Additionally, box shadows are applied to add depth and dimension to the design. Rotation is applied using the `rotate` property to give the flower a tilted appearance.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
