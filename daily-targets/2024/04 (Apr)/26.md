### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#FBD6C1`, which is a light pink shade.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document have a background color of `#FBD6C1`, matching the background color of the document.

- **Positioning (`position: fixed`):** All elements are positioned as fixed elements to ensure they stay in a fixed position within the viewport.

- **Styling (`border-radius`, `clip-path`, `border`):** 
  - The `<p>` element represents the petals of the flower. It is styled with a specific height, width, background color, and a clip-path to create a triangular shape resembling a petal. The clip-path polygon is defined to create the triangular shape with rounded corners.
  
  - The `<a>` element represents the center of the flower. It is styled with a specific height, width, and a border to create a circular shape resembling the center of the flower. The border properties are adjusted to create a curved edge at the bottom of the element.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful positioning and styling of elements.
