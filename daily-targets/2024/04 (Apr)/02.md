### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The `body` background color is set to a light green shade (`#90D3A6`), providing a soft and refreshing backdrop for the shapes.

- **Shapes (`p`, `[a]`):** Two elements contribute to the design:
  - The `<p>` element represents a large circle. It has a dark green background color (`#194E29`) and a matching text color. The circle has a height of 30 pixels, a width of 210 pixels, and a border-radius of 50%. Three box shadows are applied to create the leaf-like shapes protruding from the circle, positioned at the top, right, and left.
  - The `[a]` attribute selector targets a smaller circle within the larger circle. It represents the hole in the leaf. It is rotated 90 degrees to appear on the left side of the larger circle. It has a width of 190 pixels, creating a smaller circle within the larger one. Two box shadows are applied to create the shadow effect for the hole.

- **Positioning and Layout (`margin`):** Both the `<p>` element and the `[a]` attribute selector are positioned with margins to control their placement within the container.

- **Styling (`background`, `color`, `box-shadow`, `rotate`):** Each element has specific styling applied to create the desired visual appearance. The box shadows applied to both elements create the leaf-like shapes and shadows for the hole. The rotation is applied to the `[a]` attribute selector to position it correctly within the larger circle.

Overall, the code creates a visually appealing composition with a leaf-like shape and a hole, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
