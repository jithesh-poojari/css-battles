### Code Explanation:

- **Background Color (`background`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#631E1D`, which is a shade of dark red.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document inherit a light red background color (`#F16B4A`), providing a contrast against the background color.

- **Positioning (`position`, `margin`, `rotate`):** 
  - The `<p>` elements represent the petals of the flower. They are styled with a fixed position, specific width, height, and margin values to position them properly within the viewport. Additionally, they are rotated using the `rotate` property to give them a tilted appearance.
  
  - The `[a]` and `[b]` attribute selectors target specific petals and adjust their margins to position them properly within the flower. They are also rotated to create a symmetric arrangement of petals.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful use of CSS properties to position, style, and rotate elements.
