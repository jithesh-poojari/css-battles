</style>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Background (`body`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#0A6190`, a shade of blue.

- **Shapes (`p`):** Four `<p>` elements are used to create the petals of the flower. These elements are styled to resemble the shape of petals. They have a background color of `#EFF8FE`, a light shade, to contrast with the background color. Each petal has a border-radius set to `50q` to create a rounded appearance.

- **Positioning (`position`, `margin`):** The petals are positioned absolutely within their container. They have a margin of `130px` from the top and `5px` from the sides, adjusting their position within the container.

- **Styling (`box-shadow`):** Box shadows are applied to the petals to create a shadow effect, adding depth to the flower's appearance. The shadows are positioned to the right and left of the petals, creating a three-dimensional effect.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
