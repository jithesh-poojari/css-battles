### Stats

**Match**: 100%  
**Score**: 763.29{94}

### Code

```html
<style>
*{
  background:#EA6B62;
  +*{
    background:#512B2A;
    margin:0 250 150 0;
    box-shadow:250px 0#512B2A
  }
}
</style>
```

### Code Explanation:

- **Background (`body`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#EA6B62`, a shade of red.

- **Shapes (`*`):** Asterisk `*` selects all elements in the HTML document. All elements are styled with a background color of `#512B2A`, a dark brown shade. They also have a margin of `0px` from the top, `250px` from the right, `150px` from the bottom, and `0px` from the left, positioning them appropriately within their container.

- **Styling (`box-shadow`):** Box shadows are applied to all elements to create a shadow effect. The shadow is positioned `250px` to the right, creating a three-dimensional effect.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
