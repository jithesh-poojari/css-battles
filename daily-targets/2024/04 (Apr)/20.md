### Code

```html
<p><a>
<style>
*{
  background:#EA7457;
  >*{
    background:#B53733
  }
  +*{
    margin:0 175
  }
}
  p,a{
    position:fixed;
    padding:40;
    margin:-5-180;
    outline:50px solid#B53733;
    outline-offset:25px
  }
  a{
    margin:190 290
  }
</style>
```

- **Background (`body`):** The background color of the HTML document is set to `#EA7457`, which is a shade of red-orange.

- **Shapes (`*`):** All elements within the document, represented by the wildcard selector `*`, have a background color of `#B53733`, a deeper shade of red.

- **Positioning (`margin`):** All elements except the first (`background:#EA7457;`) have a margin of `0` on the top and bottom, and `175px` on the left and right sides. This positions them equidistant from the edges of their container.

- **Styling (`outline`, `outline-offset`, `border-radius`):** Both the `<p>` and `<a>` elements are positioned as fixed elements (`position: fixed;`). They have padding of `40px`, ensuring ample space inside each element. The `<p>` element represents the stem of the flower and has a height of `250px` and a width of `50px`, giving it a tall and narrow appearance. The `<a>` element represents the petal and is initially hidden (`<a>`). However, when targeted with the attribute selector `[a]`, it becomes visible and is rotated `90deg`, forming the petal shape. Both the stem (`<p>`) and petal (`<a>`) elements have a border-radius of `90px`, creating rounded edges.

- **Additional Styling:** The `<a>` element is positioned with a margin of `190px` from the top and `290px` from the left, placing it at the appropriate position to form the petal of the flower.

This code effectively creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with careful positioning and styling of elements to achieve the desired effect.
