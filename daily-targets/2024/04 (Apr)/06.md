### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The `body` background color is set to a dark purple shade (`#81008F`), providing a bold and intense backdrop for the shapes.

- **Shapes (`p`, `i`):** Two elements contribute to the design:
  - The `<p>` element represents a circular shape with a dark purple background color (`#81008F`). It has a height of 90 pixels and a width of 90 pixels. Positioned with a fixed position, it resembles a circle.
  - The `<i>` element represents a vertical bar with a light purple background color (`#DBBEDF`). It has a height of 90 pixels and a width of 30 pixels. Positioned with a fixed position, it resembles a vertical line.

- **Positioning and Layout (`position`, `margin`):** Both elements (`<p>`, `<i>`) are positioned with a fixed position within the viewport, allowing them to remain in a fixed location even when scrolling. The `<p>` element is positioned with a margin of 30 pixels from the top and left, while the `<i>` element is positioned with a margin of 80 pixels from the top and 30 pixels from the left.

- **Styling (`background`, `box-shadow`):** Each element has specific styling applied to create the desired visual appearance. The background color of the `<p>` element is set to dark purple (`#81008F`), while the background color of the `<i>` element is set to light purple (`#DBBEDF`). Additionally, a box shadow is applied to the `<p>` element to create a shadow effect.

Overall, the code creates a visually appealing composition with a circular shape and a vertical bar, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
