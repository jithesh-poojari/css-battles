### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The `body` background color is set to a light gray shade (`#CCC9DB`), providing a soft and neutral backdrop for the shapes.

- **Shapes (`p`, `i`):** Two elements contribute to the design:
  - The `<p>` element represents a vertical bar with a dark purple background color (`#6F5AAF`). It has a height of 120 pixels and a width of 50 pixels. Positioned absolutely within its container, it resembles the stem of a flower.
  - The `<i>` element represents a circular shape with a dark purple background color (`#200043`). It has a height and width of 30 pixels, resembling the center of a flower. Positioned absolutely within its container, it is placed slightly above the stem.

- **Positioning and Layout (`position`, `margin`):** Both elements (`<p>`, `<i>`) are positioned absolutely within their container, allowing precise control over their placement. The `<p>` element is positioned to resemble the stem of the flower, while the `<i>` element is positioned above it to represent the center.

- **Styling (`background`, `border`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`):** Each element has specific styling applied to create the desired visual appearance. The `<p>` element has a dark purple background color (`#6F5AAF`), rounded borders to create a softer appearance, and a box shadow to add depth. The `<i>` element has a dark purple background color (`#200043`) and a box shadow to enhance its appearance.

Overall, the code creates a visually appealing composition resembling a flower, with a stem and a center, achieving a perfect match and a high score.
