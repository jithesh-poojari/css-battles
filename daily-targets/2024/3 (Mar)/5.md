### Stats

**Match**: 100%  
**Score**: 617.22{330}

### Code

```html
<div class="ar1"></div>
<div class="ar2"></div>
<style>
  body {
    background: #611b1a;
    margin: 0;
  }
  .ar1,
  .ar2 {
    position: absolute;
    width: 260px;
    height: 300px;
    border: 40px solid #f16b4a;
    border-radius: 0 300px 0 0;
    border-left: 0;
  }
  .ar2 {
    right: 0;
    transform: scaleX(-1);
  }
</style>
```

### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The background color is set to a bold burgundy (#611B1A), creating a visually impactful and contrasting backdrop.

- **Rounded Rectangles (`ar1`, `ar2`):** These elements represent large rounded rectangles, with each having specific dimensions, border thickness, and border color. The `border-radius` property is utilized to achieve the rounded corners.

- **Positioning (`position`, `absolute`, `right`):** The rectangles are positioned absolutely within the `body`, and `right: 0` is used to place the second rectangle at the right edge of the viewport. The `transform: scaleX(-1)` property is applied to the second rectangle to create a mirrored effect.

- **Border Styling (`border`):** The borders of the rectangles are styled with a significant thickness (`40px`) and a bold color (#F16B4A), enhancing the visual impact of the composition.

This code successfully fulfills the challenge by creating a visually dynamic pattern of large rounded rectangles against the specified background, resulting in a perfect match percentage and score.
