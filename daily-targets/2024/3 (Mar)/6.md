### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The background color is set to a bold burgundy (#5F0032), creating a visually impactful and contrasting backdrop.

- **Squares (`sq`):** These elements represent squares with specific dimensions (`40px` x `40px`) and a light gray background color (`#D9D9D9`). The squares are positioned at different locations to form a pattern.

- **Lines (`ln`):** These elements represent lines with a width of `200px` and a height of `40px`. Similar to the squares, they have a light gray background color (`#D9D9D9`). The lines are positioned at various locations to complement the overall pattern.

- **Positioning (`position`, `absolute`):** Both squares and lines are positioned absolutely within the `body`, allowing precise control over their placement.

This code achieves a perfect match percentage and score by effectively creating an intricate and visually dynamic pattern of squares and lines against the specified background.
