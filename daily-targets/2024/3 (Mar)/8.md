### Design Explanation

In this challenge, the goal is to craft an impactful composition of shapes using HTML and CSS. The design features a combination of squares (`div`) and circular shapes (`s1`, `s2`, `s3`) forming an intricate and visually dynamic pattern against a warm golden background (`#D5954D`).

### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The background color is set to a warm golden shade (#D5954D), creating an appealing and vibrant backdrop.

- **Shapes (`div`, `s1`, `s2`, `s3`):** These elements represent a combination of squares and circular shapes. The squares (`div`) are positioned at a specific location with a background color of white (#fff) and rounded edges. The circular shapes (`s1`, `s2`, `s3`) are styled to create a visually dynamic pattern. They have a circular appearance with varying sizes and borders, contributing to the overall design.

- **Positioning (`position`, `absolute`):** The shapes are positioned absolutely within the `body`, allowing precise control over their placement.

This code achieves a perfect match percentage and score by effectively combining squares and circular shapes to create an intricate and visually dynamic pattern against the specified warm golden background.
