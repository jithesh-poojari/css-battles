### Code

```html
<div>
  <p>
  <p a>
    <style>
      * {
        background: #f48b26;
        margin: 0;
      }

      div {
        margin: 120px 110px 0;
        width: 180px;
        height: 180px;
        background: #fff;
      }

      p {
        position: fixed;
        top: 40.2px;
        left: 46.1%;
        width: 30px;
        height: 30px;
        border-radius: 50%;
        background: #fff;
      }

      [a] {
        transform: scale(2);
        top: 95px;
        left: 175px;
        border: 10px solid #f48b26;
      }
    </style>
```

### Code Explanation

- **Background (`*`):** The background color of the entire page is set to a warm golden shade (`#f48b26`), providing a visually appealing backdrop for the shapes.

- **Container (`div`):** A square container is created using a `div` element, styled with a white background (`#fff`). This container serves as the base for arranging the shapes.

- **Triangle (`p`):** The main triangular pattern is formed using two `<p>` elements. The first `<p>` creates a triangular shape, positioned at the top center of the container. It appears as a square with a circular cutout, giving the illusion of a triangle.

- **Scaling (`[a]`):** The `[a]` attribute selector is applied to the second `<p>` element, modifying its appearance. It scales the second shape to double its original size and positions it to the bottom right of the container, creating an intriguing triangular pattern with the first shape.

The overall result is a visually dynamic composition that effectively utilizes squares to form an interesting triangular design against the warm golden background.

### Code

```html
<p>
<style>
  * {
    background: #f48b26;
    >*{
      background: #fff;
    }
  }
  body {
    margin: 120 110 0;
  }
  p {
    position:fixed;
    margin:-30 60;
    width:60;
    height:60;
    border-radius:50%;
    box-shadow:0 0 0 20px#F48B26, 0 -65px 0-16q#fff;
  }
```

### Code Explanation

- **Background (`*`):** The background color of the entire page is set to a warm golden shade (`#f48b26`), providing a visually appealing backdrop for the shapes.

- **Nested Elements (`>*`):** The nested `>*` selector applies a white background (`#fff`) to all direct child elements, creating a contrast with the golden background.

- **Body (`body`):** The body element's margin is adjusted to provide spacing from the edges of the viewport.

- **Circle (`p`):** The main circular shape is created using a `<p>` element. It is positioned with `position: fixed` and given a margin to determine its location. The `border-radius` property is set to 50%, making it a perfect circle.

- **Box Shadow (`box-shadow`):** The box shadow property is utilized to create the triangular pattern. It consists of two shadows:
  - The first shadow (`0 0 0 20px #F48B26`) creates a solid outer border with a warm golden color.
  - The second shadow (`0 -65px 0 -16px #fff`) creates an inverted triangle cutout within the circle, making it appear as a triangular pattern. The negative `65px` offset determines the triangle's position and size.

This method employs a creative use of box shadows to achieve a visually intriguing triangular pattern within the circular shape against the warm golden background.
