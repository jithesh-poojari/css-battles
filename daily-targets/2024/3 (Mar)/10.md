### Code Explanation

- **Background (`*`):** The background color of the entire page is set to a warm golden shade (`#f48b26`), providing a visually appealing backdrop for the shapes.

- **Container (`div`):** A square container is created using a `div` element, styled with a white background (`#fff`). This container serves as the base for arranging the shapes.

- **Triangle (`p`):** The main triangular pattern is formed using two `<p>` elements. The first `<p>` creates a triangular shape, positioned at the top center of the container. It appears as a square with a circular cutout, giving the illusion of a triangle.

- **Scaling (`[a]`):** The `[a]` attribute selector is applied to the second `<p>` element, modifying its appearance. It scales the second shape to double its original size and positions it to the bottom right of the container, creating an intriguing triangular pattern with the first shape.

The overall result is a visually dynamic composition that effectively utilizes squares to form an interesting triangular design against the warm golden background.
