### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The `body` background color is set to a light yellow shade (`#EAEB8D`), providing a bright and vibrant backdrop for the shapes.

- **Shapes (`div`, `[a]`):** Two elements contribute to the design. The `div` element represents a trapezoidal shape with a dark orange background (`#FECE22`). It is positioned at the top center of the background using absolute positioning. The `[a]` attribute selector modifies another trapezoidal shape with a slightly lighter orange background (`#F48B26`). It is positioned below the first trapezoidal shape.

- **Positioning (`position`, `absolute`):** Both elements (`div` and `[a]`) are absolutely positioned to allow precise control over their placement.

- **Border Styling (`border`):** The `border` property is applied to the `div` element to create the trapezoidal shape with borders.

- **Rotation (`rotate`):** The `[a]` attribute selector applies a rotation effect to the second trapezoidal shape, rotating it by 180 degrees.

- **Shadow Effects (`box-shadow`):** The `box-shadow` property is used to add shadow effects to both shapes, enhancing their visual appeal.

The overall result is a visually dynamic composition with two trapezoidal shapes against a light yellow background, achieving a near-perfect match and a high score.
