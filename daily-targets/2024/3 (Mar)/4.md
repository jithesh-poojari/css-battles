### Code Explanation

- **Background (`body`):** The background color is set to a rich purple (#3A2A5D), creating a visually appealing and contrasting backdrop.

- **Shapes (`ln1`, `ln2`, `ln3`, `ar1`, `ar2`):** The design incorporates horizontal lines and rounded rectangles. These elements are positioned strategically to form an engaging and balanced pattern.

- **Horizontal Lines (`ln1`, `ln2`, `ln3`):** These elements represent horizontal lines with specific heights and positions, contributing to the overall composition.

- **Rounded Rectangles (`ar1`, `ar2`):** These elements are styled as rounded rectangles, creating a curved and dynamic visual effect. They are carefully positioned to complement the horizontal lines.

- **Positioning (`top`, `left`):** The positioning of each element is adjusted to achieve the desired pattern, ensuring symmetry and balance in the composition.

This code successfully achieves the challenge by creating an engaging composition of shapes, resulting in a perfect match percentage and score.
