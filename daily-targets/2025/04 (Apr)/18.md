## ✅ Code Explanation

This target renders a **concentric circle** design on a **dark blue background** (`#2D3464`) using a **single HTML element (`<p>`)** and smart use of `box-shadow`.

### 🎨 Background

The universal selector (`*`) sets the entire page background to the deep blue color. Then, using the adjacent sibling combinator (`+*`), it targets the element after `<p>` — effectively applying styles to a generated pseudo-sibling.

But since you only have `<p>` as your tag, this trick instead creates the illusion by styling `<p>` directly using nested selectors (efficient and compact).

### 🟣 Concentric Circles with Box Shadows

The key visual is formed using `box-shadow` with multiple spreads:

- The `border-radius: 50%` makes the base shape circular.
- The first shadow (`0 0 0 21q #D9D9D9`) adds a **light gray ring** around the central circle.
- The second shadow (`0 0 0 42q #646DAB`) adds a **larger bluish ring** outside it.

These layers are all stacked perfectly by controlling spread radius without offsets. The result is a bullseye-style effect — circle within a circle within a circle.

### 📏 Centering

The `margin: 110 160` centers the circle horizontally and vertically by offsetting from the top-left corner. Meanwhile, the `<p>` tag itself is given `position: fixed` and `padding: 80`, making it act as the solid inner core of the circle.

### 🧠 Techniques Used

- **Nested universal selectors** for concise styling with minimal characters.
- **Box-shadow spread technique** to layer multiple concentric rings.
- **Only one HTML element** used — no pseudo-elements or extra markup.
- **Precise positioning and spacing** with `margin` and `padding` to align everything perfectly.
