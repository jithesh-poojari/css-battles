## âœ… Code Explanation

This design displays a **green canvas** with a large **downward-pointing triangle** that contains **evenly spaced vertical stripes** in a contrasting color.

---

### ðŸŒ¿ Background

The canvas is filled with a **green shade** using the outer universal selector. Specifically, the background is set to `#5A9F48`.

---

### ðŸ”» Triangle Shape

Inside this, a single nested element is clipped into a triangle using the `clip-path` property. The shape is defined as `polygon(50% 100%, 0% 0, 100% 0)`, which creates a triangle pointing downwards, starting from the top-left and top-right corners and meeting at the center of the bottom edge.

The triangle is centered and pushed downward slightly using `margin: 100 70`.

---

### ðŸŸª Vertical Stripes

Instead of using multiple elements, the design uses a **linear gradient background** to simulate the stripes. The gradient flows **from right to left** (`to left`) and alternates between dark purple (`#2A2753`) and transparent green (`#5A9F48`) at precise percentage stops.

The color stops are defined like this: `#2A2753 17%, #5A9F48 0 29%, #2A2753 0 44%, #5A9F48 0 56%, #2A2753 0 71%, #5A9F48 0 83%, #2A2753 0`. This creates sharply defined vertical bars within the triangle.

### ðŸ§  Techniques Used

- The **outer universal selector** sets the canvas background.
- The **inner universal selector** targets the only child element and applies the triangle shape and striped gradient.
- **Clip-path** trims the box into a perfect downward triangle.
- A **sharp multi-stop linear gradient** is used to simulate multiple vertical bars with no extra markup.
- **Precise margins** place the shape neatly in the upper-middle of the canvas.
