## âœ… Code Explanation

This design shows a **green diamond ring**: a rotated green square with a white ring centered inside it, all placed on a white background.

---

### ðŸŽ¨ Background and Structure

The outermost `*` selector sets the **entire canvas background to white** (`#FFF`).  
Inside it, there's a **nested universal selector (`*`)**, which sets the background of all children to **green** (`#5A9F48`).  
This trick cascades the green background to elements like `<p>`, `<a>`, and `<b>`.

The `+*` selector (adjacent sibling) targets the **second element** (in this case, `<a>`) and turns it into a **green circle**:

- It uses `border-radius: 50%` to make it perfectly round.
- The margin (`30 80`) places the circle near the top-left quadrant.

---

### ðŸŸ© The Rotated Green Diamond (Square)

The `<p>` tag is the primary shape used here.

- It is positioned `fixed` so it stays in place regardless of viewport movement.
- `Padding: 50+15` turns it into a square-like shape.
- `Rotate: 45deg` turns the green square into a **diamond**.
- `Margin: 66 130` places it neatly in the center.

---

### âšª Creating the Ring Effect

The `<p>` tag also includes a **white ring illusion** using a `box-shadow`:

- `Box-shadow: 22q 22q 0 21q #FFF` places a large **white circular shadow** offset diagonally from the center.
- This white shadow overlays part of the green diamond, forming what visually looks like a **white ring within a green rotated square**.

---

### ðŸ§  Techniques Used

- **Nested universal selectors** cascade styles without explicitly targeting each tag.
- **Adjacent sibling selector** (`+*`) is used smartly to target and round only one shape without needing classes.
- **Fixed positioning** helps precisely align shapes regardless of scroll.
- **Rotation (`rotate: 45deg`)** transforms a square into a diamond â€” simple yet effective.
- **Box-shadow** acts as an efficient duplicate shape, avoiding extra elements while creating visual depth.
