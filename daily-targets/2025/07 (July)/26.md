## âœ… Code Explanation

This solution replicates a **watch face with a strap** using a single `<p>` tag and clever use of shorthand CSS. The structure is lean, using minimal HTML and tightly packed styles.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Visual Strategy

* The background sets a light bluish tone for the entire canvas, creating contrast with the central elements.
* The `<p>` tag forms the **main circular watch face** using a high `padding`, balanced `margin`, and rounded edges.
* The **strap ends** are simulated using `box-shadow`, placing three precise blobs around the central shape â€” one above, two on the sides â€” giving the illusion of extended bands.

---

### ðŸ§  Techniques Used

* **Box-shadow layering**: Instead of multiple elements, multiple shadows build all parts: the top strap, side lugs, and outer edge.
* **Q unit**: Quirky but effective for shorthand spacing and radius in this constrained environment.
* **Single-element design**: One `<p>` tag carries all the visual weight, styled heavily to produce both form and depth.
* **Character optimization**: Colors and values are chosen not just visually, but for brevity (e.g., shorthand hex codes, stripped `px`).
