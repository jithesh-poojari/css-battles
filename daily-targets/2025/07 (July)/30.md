## âœ… Code Explanation

This solution creates a visually layered circular design using a single `<p>` tag and CSS nesting.

### ðŸŽ¯ Visual Strategy

* The background is set to a greenish tone using a universal selector.
* The nested universal selector (`*`) adds a large `box-shadow` that acts as a backdrop.
* The inner circle is made circular with `border-radius: 50%`.
* The `<p>` element is fixed in position and styled to generate three overlapping circular shapes using `box-shadow`.

### ðŸ§  Techniques Used

* Deep nesting of universal selectors helps cascade style properties compactly.
* `box-shadow` with multiple values creates layered circles to mimic depth.
* `q` units are used for precision and character efficiency.
* Negative margins and calculated padding (`85+15`) help fine-tune alignment without increasing byte count.
* Colors and positioning are optimized to match the original challenge target exactly.

This minimalist yet effective approach uses nested selectors and layered shadows to construct a clean, character-efficient visual in CSS Battle.
