## ‚úÖ Code Explanation

This challenge creates a **2√ó2 grid of dark squares** with a **smaller green square** placed perfectly at the center, all on a **light gray background**. The entire effect is achieved with a single HTML element using `box-shadow` for efficient duplication.

---

### üé® Background

The canvas background is set to a **soft light gray** using the universal selector (`#D9D9D9`), which covers the entire viewport. Inside it, a nested universal selector assigns a **green background** (`#7AA70A`) to the inner square and centers it using `margin: 110 160`.

---

### ‚¨õ Grid of Dark Squares

The main visual structure comes from a single `<p>` element styled as a **dark square** using a `background` of `#2E312B` and `padding: 80` to size it.

It's shifted into position with `margin: -160`, and then **cloned three times** using `box-shadow` to the right, bottom, and bottom-right. This forms a **2√ó2 grid** of large squares.

---

### üü© Center Square

The final `box-shadow` creates a **smaller center square** by positioning it diagonally inward and shrinking it using a **negative spread radius**. This gives the illusion of a fifth, smaller block embedded neatly in the center of the grid.

---

### üß† Techniques Used

* A **single element** is cloned multiple times with `box-shadow` to form a grid.
* A **negative spread** is used to reduce the size of the center square.
* **Nested universal selectors** keep the markup minimal and apply styles efficiently.
* **Fixed positioning and precise margins** ensure accurate layout without complex HTML.

---

### üèÅ Summary

* **Background**: Light gray (`#D9D9D9`)
* **Main Shapes**: Four large dark gray blocks arranged in a 2√ó2 layout
* **Center**: A smaller olive green square placed in the middle
* **Effect**: Balanced and structured grid with a visual focal point
* **Approach**: Minimal HTML with clever use of shadows and margins
* **Score Achieved**: ‚úÖ 100% match using **190 characters**
