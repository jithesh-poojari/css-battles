## ‚úÖ Code Explanation

This challenge features a **tall vertical bar** with **three small circular dots** horizontally arranged to the left. The composition is minimal and centers around strong vertical alignment, with clean geometric styling.

---

### üé® Background

The entire canvas is painted with a **deep desaturated blue** (`#2F5A76`), applied using the universal selector. This dark base sets a strong contrast against the yellow foreground shapes.

---

### üüß Central Vertical Bar

The `<p>` element forms the **tall vertical capsule** in the center:

* It uses a **bright yellow-orange** color (`#F5BB60`).
* The size is achieved through tall padding (`15+140`), giving it a slim vertical rectangle shape.
* Positioned centrally using margin, it's further extended downward with `box-shadow: 0 286q`, effectively cloning it below to create a **double-height vertical column** with just one shadow.

This forms a **central vertical bar**, split into two equal-height segments stacked vertically.

---

### üü° Left-Aligned Circles

The `<a>` element generates three **perfect yellow circles** arranged horizontally:

* Padding and `border-radius: 50%` produce circular shapes.
* The base element is placed to the left side with `margin: 120 -250`.
* Two `box-shadow` values (`138q 0`, `275q 0`) clone it rightward, forming a **row of three equally spaced circles**.

Together, these create a **row of circular dots** aligned left of the tall central bar, maintaining perfect symmetry.

---

### üß† Techniques Used

* **Box-shadow duplication** is used to repeat both the vertical bar and the circular dots without additional HTML.
* **`border-radius: 50%`** is used to create perfect circles.
* **Positioning with margins** allows clean alignment of elements across axes.
* **Minimal HTML structure** (just two tags) is used to construct a multi-part design.

---

### üèÅ Summary

* **Background**: Desaturated blue (`#2F5A76`)
* **Main Shapes**:

  * A tall vertical yellow-orange bar (duplicated with shadow)
  * A row of three small yellow-orange circles (duplicated with shadow)
* **Effect**: A clean, structured UI-style layout with central alignment and visual rhythm
* **Approach**: Clever use of box-shadow for cloning, with minimal elements and well-tuned spacing
