## ✅ Code Explanation

This challenge presents a **rounded white rectangle** with a **small dark blue button** at the top-left, resembling a UI toggle or a control panel element, all placed on a **bright yellow background**.

---

### 🎨 Background

The entire canvas is filled with a **vivid yellow color** (`#F0CD48`) using the universal `*` selector. This forms a bold and clean backdrop.

---

### 🟨 Main White Panel

A `+*` sibling selector is used inside the universal rule to target the second element (`<p>` is the first), which applies:

* `background: #FFF` — the panel is white.
* `border: 11q solid #394257` — giving it a thick dark blue border.
* `border-radius: 22q` — rounding the edges for a soft, UI-like shape.
* `margin: 110 20` — positions it toward the center, vertically and horizontally.

The result is a **centered rounded rectangle with a dark border**, simulating a device or card container.

---

### 🔵 Top-Left Button

The `<p>` element itself is styled as a **small dark button**:

* `background: #394257` — same dark blue as the panel border.
* `padding: 22+5` — small dimensions, forming a compact pill.
* `margin: 8 14` — places it at the top-left of the canvas, aligning neatly over the larger white rectangle below.

This resembles a **toggle or LED indicator**, giving the composition a clean and modern interface look.

---

### 🧠 Techniques Used

* **Sibling combinator `+*`** is cleverly used to target only the second element (the main panel), reducing selector length.
* **Compact border-radius and border values** produce a smooth and strong contrast between shapes.
* **Minimal HTML** is maintained by extracting both visual elements from a single element and its sibling.

---

### 🏁 Summary

* **Background**: Bright Yellow (`#F0CD48`)
* **Elements**:

  * Small dark blue circular button (top-left)
  * Large white rounded rectangle with a dark border (centered)
* **Effect**: Clean, card-like UI block with a button
* **Approach**: Uses sibling selector tricks and efficient box modeling
* **Score Achieved**: ✅ 100% match with only **166 characters**
