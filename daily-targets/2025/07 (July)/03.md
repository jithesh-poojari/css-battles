## ✅ Code Explanation

This challenge forms a **cross-like layout** using **five rounded pink blocks** positioned on a **muted red background** (`#CE636F`). The visual rhythm is created by strategically placing shapes using `box-shadow`, with minimal HTML.

---

### 🎨 Background

The canvas is filled with a **muted red** shade (`#CE636F`) using the global `*` selector. This sets the base for all elements.

Inside a nested universal selector, all child elements are given a **light pink background** (`#F7BED9`), establishing the color of the visible blocks.

---

### 🟪 Rounded Blocks Layout

The `<p>` element is the core shape from which all visible blocks are derived.

* **Base Shape**:

  * `padding: 40` creates a square block.
  * `border-radius: 42q` makes the corners fully rounded, resulting in a pill/capsule.
  * `margin: 0 -80` horizontally shifts it to the left of center.

* **Positioning**:

  * `position: fixed` allows precise placement.
  * The actual shape appears centered, while the `box-shadow` clones it into a cross pattern.

* **`box-shadow` Clones**:

  * `85q 0`: Clones to the right.
  * `254q 0`: Further right.
  * `169q 85q`: Bottom-right.
  * `339q 0 #F7BED9`: Final far-right clone.

Together, these shadows and the base shape form a **cross or “Tetris-like” figure** — three blocks in a row with two extending downward, neatly composed with a single element.

---

### 🧠 Techniques Used

* **Nested universal selectors** apply consistent styling to child elements.
* **Box-shadow** is used to clone and arrange multiple blocks without extra HTML.
* **Border-radius + padding** give consistent pill-like shapes.
* **Fixed positioning and tuned margin** enable pixel-perfect placement.

---

### 🏁 Summary

* **Background**: Muted red (`#CE636F`)
* **Shapes**: Five rounded pink blocks in a T-shaped layout
* **Effect**: Symmetric, clean, and minimal
* **Approach**: One element + box shadows + smart layout math
* **Score Achieved**: ✅ 100% match using only **188 characters**
