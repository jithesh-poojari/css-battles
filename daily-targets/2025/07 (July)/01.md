## ✅ Code Explanation

This challenge features a **capsule-shaped dark bar** in the center of the screen, with a **smaller inner bar**, both horizontally aligned. The design sits on a **muted teal background**, giving it a clean and minimal look.

---

### 🎨 Background

The entire canvas is filled with a **teal tone** (`#51A499`) using the global `*` selector. This background provides a calm, cool base that contrasts well with the darker foreground bars.

---

### 🟦 Outer Capsule

The `<p>` element forms the **main capsule**:

* It uses `padding: 110+40`, which creates a wide, rounded horizontal bar.
* `border-radius: 52q` ensures the ends are fully rounded, giving it a capsule shape.
* It's centered on the screen using `fixed` positioning with `margin: 42 112`.
* The fill color is a **dark blue-gray** (`#23384B`), making it stand out against the background.

---

### ⬛ Inner Bar

The `<a>` element adds a **slightly smaller horizontal bar**, layered inside the capsule:

* Its `padding: 70+40` makes it shorter vertically but keeps the same horizontal roundness.
* It’s offset inside the main capsule using `margin: -70 -40` to center it perfectly.
* A `box-shadow` (`85q 0 #23384B`) duplicates it to the right, helping reinforce the central alignment and fill the shape completely.

This creates a **nested capsule look**, where the smaller inner bar feels recessed into the larger one.

---

### 🧠 Techniques Used

* **Border-radius with quadrant units (`q`)** makes pill shapes compactly.
* **Fixed positioning + negative margin** is used to center nested shapes precisely.
* **Box-shadow cloning** is leveraged to duplicate shapes without additional HTML.
* **Color contrast** between background and bar creates visual depth.

### 🏁 Summary

* **Background**: Teal (`#51A499`)
* **Main Shape**: Wide capsule (`#23384B`) centered on the canvas
* **Inner Shape**: Smaller nested bar using margin and shadow
* **Effect**: A clean, layered capsule layout
* **Approach**: Uses minimal HTML, smart shadow tricks, and precise padding
* **Score Achieved**: ✅ 100% match using only **170 characters**
