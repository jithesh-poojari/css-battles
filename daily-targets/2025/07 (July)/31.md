## âœ… Code Explanation

### ðŸŽ¯ **Design Strategy (No Code)**

1. **Canvas Color**
   The background is a deep navy (`#23384B`), applied globally.

2. **Primary Shape - Yellow Circle**
   The main yellow circle (`#F0CD48`) is created by:

   * Giving the `<p>` tag a large circular shape via `border-radius`.
   * Using a centered `box-shadow` with two extra shadows positioned horizontally and vertically.

3. **Positioning & Layout**

   * `margin` and `padding` are calculated using expressions like `70+25` to save characters.
   * `position: fixed` locks the circle into place and makes alignment easier across screen sizes.
   * `box-shadow` values control the offsets and simulate additional circles.

4. **Efficiency Moves**

   * `q` units (1q = 1px) are used for character saving.
   * Nesting universal selectors (`* *`) applies inner styles without extra element selectors.
   * Color is applied via `color:` which affects the `background` due to nesting â€” a clever trick to avoid repeating `background:`.

### ðŸ§  **What Makes It Smart**

* **Character Optimization**: Math expressions (`70+25`) reduce character count while keeping the values readable by the browser.
* **Visual Layering with Shadows**: The use of `box-shadow` for multiple shapes keeps HTML minimal.
* **Deep Nesting for Reusability**: Styles cascade from one selector to the next with minimal overhead.
