## ‚úÖ Code Explanation

This target shows **two vertical columns** of **three white pills each**, placed symmetrically on a **green background**. The layout is minimal, elegant, and perfectly aligned using box-shadow and repeated styling.

---

### üé® Background

The canvas is filled with a **vibrant green** (`#48BF7D`) using the universal selector, setting a bright and fresh base tone for the layout.

---

### ‚ö™ Vertical White Pills

Three HTML elements (`<p>`, `<a>`, and `<b>`) are used, all styled identically to represent pill shapes:

* Each element is given a **white background**.
* Padding values like `40+15` make them appear as **tall vertical pills**.
* `color` is matched to the background (`#FFF`) to avoid any text display.
* `box-shadow` duplicates the original pill vertically, creating two additional pills below each one (spaced at `101q` and `201q` units).

This means **each element generates three vertical pills** ‚Äî one from the element itself and two from the shadow.

To create the **two-column layout**, two of the three elements (`<a>` and `<b>`) are shifted to the right using a horizontal margin (`margin: -40 155`), forming the **right-side column**, while the first element (`<p>`) stays left.

The result is **two vertical columns of pills**, each with three stacked pills, neatly aligned and perfectly symmetric.

---

### üß† Techniques Used

* **Box-shadow duplication** to efficiently clone pill shapes with minimal HTML.
* **Multiple elements reused with identical styles**, but different horizontal positioning, to split the grid into two columns.
* **Fixed positioning and fine-tuned margin** ensure visual balance and pixel-perfect alignment.
* **No need for explicit border-radius** because the pill shape is formed naturally through the padding ratio.

### üèÅ Summary

* **Background**: Bright green (`#48BF7D`)
* **Shapes**: Two vertical columns of three white pill-shaped blocks
* **Effect**: Symmetric and clean, resembling UI pills or buttons
* **Approach**: Minimal HTML (just three tags) and smart use of shadows and margins
* **Score Achieved**: ‚úÖ 100% match using **150 characters**
