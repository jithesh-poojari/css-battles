## ‚úÖ Code Explanation

This challenge features a **grid of six pale yellow vertical pills** on a **purple background**, aligned in **three rows and two columns**. One shape appears repeated across rows and columns, forming a clean, tile-like pattern.

---

### üé® Background

The canvas is filled with a **deep purple** (`#504B72`) using the universal selector. This sets a contrasting base for the pale yellow pills.

---

### üü® Vertical Pills (Grid Layout)

Both the `<p>` and `<a>` elements use the same pill shape ‚Äî a vertical rectangle with rounded ends:

* They use `background: #FFFBCC` for a soft pale yellow tone.
* Padding values like `30+50` and `10+60` give them a **tall, narrow shape**, and the lack of a specific `border-radius` still gives them a rounded pill appearance due to the padding ratio.
* `position: fixed` allows free placement across the canvas.

The **box-shadow** on each element is the core of the layout:

* `<p>` produces five clones: two to the right and three below the main shape, creating a **3√ó2 grid**.
* `<a>` reinforces the layout with an additional clone for better alignment, using vertical box-shadows.

Together, these six pills are arranged evenly in two columns and three rows.

---

### üß† Techniques Used

* **Box-shadow cloning** replicates the base pill shape across the grid without extra HTML elements.
* **Precise padding and margins** control the shape and layout.
* **Multiple elements** are used efficiently to manage offsets and grid spacing with fewer characters.
* **Fixed positioning** allows complete control over layout and spacing.

### üèÅ Summary

* **Background**: Deep purple (`#504B72`)
* **Shapes**: Six tall pale yellow vertical pills arranged in 3 rows and 2 columns
* **Effect**: Neat, symmetric grid of vertical bars
* **Approach**: Minimal elements with strategic use of box-shadow for duplication
* **Score Achieved**: ‚úÖ 100% match using **204 characters**
