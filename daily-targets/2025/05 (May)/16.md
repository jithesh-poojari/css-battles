## âœ… Code Explanation

The HTML uses a clever nesting trick: `<p><a><b><c><d>`. This gives us five elements to style using only a single HTML tag â€” a common space-saving tactic in CSS Battle.

---

### ðŸŽ¨ Global Styles

The universal selector (`*`) applies to all elements:

* Sets the canvas background to **green** (`#5A9F48`).
* Applies `position: fixed` to each element so they can be positioned precisely without being affected by document flow.

---

### âš« Four Black Circles â€“ `<p>`, `<a>`, `<b>`, `<c>`

These four elements are styled identically with:

* A thick **black border** (`32q solid #000`) which defines the size of the circles.
* **Padding: 40**, which increases the internal size of each circle.
* `border-radius: 50%` to make them perfectly circular.
* Different `margin` values to control the **positioning** of each circle on the canvas:

  * `<p>` starts at `margin: 72 92`.
  * `<a>` is shifted slightly up and left with `margin: -70 -10`.
  * `<b>` shifts further left with `margin: -15 -100`.
  * `<c>` moves dramatically up and left with `margin: -180 -70`.

These carefully offset margins allow the black circles to form a precise visual composition.

---

### âš« Fifth Element â€“ `<d>`

* Only uses **padding: 25** to define its size.
* Positioned with `margin: 30 -25`, placing it slightly lower and to the left of the last circle.
* No `border`, no `border-radius` â€” which makes it appear as a **solid green dot** (matching the background) that covers part of one of the black circles, forming a cutout or masking effect.

---

### ðŸ§  Techniques Used

* **Nesting elements** to avoid extra HTML characters.
* **Fixed positioning** for absolute placement.
* **Border trick** to create perfectly circular outlines.
* **Minimal use of colors** â€” only black and background green.
* **Negative margins** to stack and overlap the circles.
* **Precise spacing** and alignment using shorthand values like `32q`, `40`, and `25`.
