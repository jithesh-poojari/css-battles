## âœ… Code Explanation

The HTML consists of nested elements: `<p><a><b><c><d>`. This nesting trick allows multiple elements using a single tag, giving us five block-level elements to work with without increasing HTML size.

---

### ðŸŽ¨ Global Styling

The universal selector `*` sets the canvas background to `#F4DA64`, a light yellow tone. All elements are positioned with `fixed`, allowing precise control over their placement on the screen.

---

### ðŸŸ¥ First Two Layers â€“ `<p>` and `<a>`

Both `p` and `a` use the same `linear-gradient` background, transitioning from red (`#D95F5B`) at the top to blue (`#243D83`) immediately after (`11%` stop). This gives the appearance of a red-top, blue-bottom bar.

They both have a padding of `45+20`, creating their height and width. The first block `<p>` is placed at `margin: 22 172`, centering it horizontally and setting it toward the top. The second block `<a>` is pushed down with `margin: 95 -20`, overlapping slightly to create a layered look, and offset slightly to the left.

---

### ðŸŸ¦ Lower Three Layers â€“ `<b>`, `<c>`, and `<d>`

These elements share a slightly adjusted gradient split: `#D95F5B 20%, #243D83 0`, giving a more dominant red area before transitioning to blue.

All three are initially styled with `padding: 25+40` and `margin: -95 -110`, placing them below the upper layers and overlapping each other.

`<c>` is further adjusted with `margin: -25 50` and smaller padding (`25+20`) to shrink and offset it rightward, creating a stepped appearance.

`<d>` tweaks the position again with `margin: -25 30`, making the final block in the stack appear shifted horizontally for the final overlap.

### ðŸ§  Techniques Used

* **Nested tags** to create multiple styled blocks from a single HTML tag.
* **Fixed positioning** for absolute control over element layout.
* **Linear gradients** to simulate color splitting with red on top and blue below.
* **Negative margins** for overlapping and vertical stacking of elements.
* **Math shorthand in padding/margin** (like `45+20`) to reduce character count.
* **Minimalist HTML** (just one tag) with rich visual output.
