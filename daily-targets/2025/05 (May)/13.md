## ✅ Code Explanation

This challenge presents a vertically centered capsule with two semi-circles above it, creating a totem-like structure — all placed over a beige background.

### 🎨 Background

The universal selector applies a light beige color (`#E3CC9E`) to the entire canvas. This forms a soft and neutral base that helps the red elements stand out clearly.

### 🟥 Central Pill (`<p>`)

The `<p>` tag is a vertical rectangle positioned using `fixed`. Padding is used to define its height and width (`80+20`), and it’s moved into place with a margin of `132 172`. The background is set to red (`#D95F5B`), creating the middle section of the totem.

### 🟣 Upper Semi-Circles (`<a>` and `<b>`)

Both `<a>` and `<b>` tags are styled identically with wide horizontal padding (`60+120`) and a top-only border radius (`130q 130q 0 0`), giving them the look of domes or half-circles.

They are moved into place above the `<p>` using negative margins (`-190-120`), causing them to overlap downward over the central rectangle.

### 🔁 Cloning Effect (`<b>`)

The `<b>` tag is scaled down to one-third size using `scale: -0.33`, which also flips it. It’s then offset using `margin: 20-40`, and a clever `box-shadow` (with a massive horizontal offset of `514q`) is used to duplicate the shape to the right. This way, both semicircles appear symmetrically above the center.

### 🧠 Techniques Used

* Multiple HTML tags reused for layered shapes.
* `box-shadow` trick to clone shapes without more HTML.
* `scale` to flip and resize one shape.
* Minimal use of properties like `padding` and `margin` for layout efficiency.
* All elements positioned with `fixed` to control placement tightly.
