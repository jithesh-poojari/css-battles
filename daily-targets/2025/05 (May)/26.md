## ‚úÖ Code Explanation

This challenge displays a plus-like layout made of four **rounded green bars** arranged on a **dark green background**. These bars are laid out vertically and horizontally, mirrored both ways, forming a cross pattern.

---

### üü© Background

The universal selector (`*`) sets the background color to a deep green (`#186D37`), giving the entire canvas a solid base color.

---

### üß± Base Shape Setup

The tags `<p>`, `<a>`, `<b>`, and `<c>` are all positioned using `position: fixed`, which lets you place them freely without relying on the normal document flow. Each element:

* Gets a light green background (`#48BF7D`)
* Has padding applied with a horizontal bias (taller than wide), which results in a rounded pill shape
* Uses a margin to position it around the center
* Uses a `box-shadow` to duplicate the exact same shape lower on the canvas, effectively rendering two bars from a single element

---

### üîÑ Rotation for Horizontal Bars

The `<a>` and `<c>` elements are rotated by 90 degrees. This transforms the vertical pill shape into a horizontal bar. Their margins are adjusted to place them correctly on the canvas, aligning them in the left and right positions of the cross layout.

---

### ‚úñÔ∏è Scaling and Diagonal Positioning

The `<b>` element is scaled to twice its normal size using `scale: 2`, making it visually dominant. It‚Äôs rotated by 45 degrees, giving it a diagonal twist that adds complexity to the layout. Its margin is also customized to position it just right to not overlap or break the balance of the design.

---

### üß† Techniques Used

* Minimal HTML elements (just four tags) create eight visible bars using `box-shadow`
* Rotations (`rotate: 90deg` and `rotate: 45deg`) let the same shape serve different visual roles
* `scale` increases the size without needing extra markup
* Inline math expressions (like `padding: 10+25`) reduce character count
* Custom tags like `<c>` are valid in HTML and help squeeze in functionality within the strict character limit
