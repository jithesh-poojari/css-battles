## ✅ Code Explanation

This design features **two mirrored purple capsule-like shapes** on a **light cream background**, resembling a stylized "E" or twin arches facing each other.

---

### 🎨 Background and Base

The entire canvas is given a **soft cream background** using the universal selector. This sets the visual foundation and ensures any added elements contrast clearly.

---

### 🟪 Shape Creation with `<p>` and `<a>`

Both `<p>` and `<a>` elements are used to create purple blocks:

* They are fixed in position to maintain consistent layout regardless of viewport changes.
* A purple background color is applied to both elements.
* Padding creates a block-sized shape.
* A margin positions the shapes around the center-top area.
* A border-radius of 22q on the top corners gives the shapes a capsule-like appearance.

---

### 🔁 Mirroring with Box Reflect

The `<a>` tag is further customized to make the overall structure symmetrical:

* The corner rounding is changed so that only one top and one bottom corner are rounded, creating visual variety.
* A separate margin moves the element slightly for spacing.
* Most importantly, a CSS reflection using `-webkit-box-reflect` is applied to the left side with a horizontal offset. This mirrors the block, producing a duplicate facing the original block.

---

### ✨ Visual Outcome

Combining these techniques results in **two facing purple blocks**, shaped differently but placed in a symmetric layout. The reflection trick smartly avoids writing duplicate elements in the HTML, which is especially important for character-limited challenges like CSS Battle.

---

### 🧠 Techniques Used

* Using `position: fixed` and `margin` to precisely control layout without extra markup.
* Using `padding` instead of `width` and `height` to save characters while still shaping elements.
* Creating capsule shapes by strategically rounding corners with `border-radius`.
* Reflecting an element using `box-reflect` to produce symmetry with minimal HTML.
