## âœ… Code Explanation

Used just two HTML elements â€” `<p>` and `<a>` â€” a minimal and effective approach to get the job done with a low character count.

---

### ðŸŽ¨ Background

The canvas background is set to a dark gray color `#282828`, which becomes the foundation on which the design elements stand out.

---

### ðŸŸ§ Main Shape Creation

Both `<p>` and `<a>` are absolutely positioned (`position: fixed`), given a uniform `padding` of `20`, and a `margin` of `22 72` to position them on the screen.

Each element uses a `box-shadow` offset of `21q 21q`, with no blur and a spread of `21q`, colored `#F9DDC6`. This simulates a large rounded quarter shape â€” like a soft blob in one corner of the box.

Then comes the clever trick: `-webkit-box-reflect: right 160px` â€” this mirrors the shape horizontally to the right, producing a second identical blob automatically.

---

### ðŸ”„ Flipping the Second Element

The `<a>` element is flipped horizontally using `scale: -1`, which mirrors its visual content. It's also repositioned with `margin: 180` to move it to the bottom part of the canvas.

Combined with the reflection, this creates two more blobs â€” one directly and one as a mirror â€” effectively filling all four corners of a square grid.

---

### ðŸ§  Key Techniques Used

* Minimal HTML: Only two tags.
* Box-shadow with large spread radius to simulate circular shapes.
* WebKit reflection to mirror elements without extra DOM.
* CSS `scale` to flip elements and reduce duplication.
* Fixed positioning for precise layout.
