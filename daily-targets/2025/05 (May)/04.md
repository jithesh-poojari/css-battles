## âœ… Code Explanation

This CSS Battle target creates a **stylized circular shape** with a **color-striped background**, using only one HTML element (`<p>`) and clever CSS layering.

---

### ðŸŽ¨ Background and Gradient Setup

The universal selector `*` sets the entire canvas background to a **pale yellow** (`#FAE29E`).

Then, the adjacent sibling selector `+*` targets the next element (the `<p>` tag), applying a **vertical linear gradient** as its background. This gradient has three bands:

* Top 41%: **Teal green** (`#4A9A86`)
* Middle 18% (from 41% to 59%): **Pale yellow** (`#FAE29E`) â€” blending into the background
* Bottom 41%: **Dark blue** (`#4C4C6B`)

The `margin: 40 75` shifts this element slightly downward and centers it horizontally.

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Central Circle with Shadow

The `<p>` element is absolutely positioned using `position: fixed`.

It uses a combined `padding: 25+85`, which is parsed as `110`, to create a large square. Because there's no content and it later becomes circular, this creates a **donut-like shape**.

`margin: 0 40` centers it horizontally, while vertical positioning is handled by the fixed layout and the `box-shadow`.

The `box-shadow: 0 180q #FAE29E` creates a second identical circle **below** the original, using the same pale yellow as the background to give a seamless duplicated appearance.

---

### ðŸ§  Techniques Used

* **Universal selector and sibling combinator** to minimize HTML usage and style multiple elements efficiently.
* **Linear gradient** to simulate a background with stacked color bands.
* **Padding-based circles**: Avoids setting width/height explicitly, using `border-radius` via padding.
* **Box-shadow**: Used to visually duplicate the main circle with minimal markup.
* **Character-efficient CSS**: Operators like `+` and units like `q` are used to keep code compact for CSS Battle scoring.
