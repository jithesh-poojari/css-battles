## ‚úÖ Code Explanation

This solution creates four overlapping leaf-like shapes arranged symmetrically in a rotated X pattern, using just two HTML elements: a `<p>` and an `<a>` tag. The magic happens through precise use of `box-shadow`, mirroring, and minimal styling.

---

### üé® Background

The universal selector sets the background color to lime green (`#BFE33A`). This acts as the canvas and the visible space between the leaf shapes.

---

### üçÉ Leaf Shapes with Box-Shadow

Both the `<p>` and `<a>` elements are given fixed positioning, equal padding, and a top-centered margin to place them near the upper half of the canvas. Each of these elements uses a `box-shadow` with three parts:

1. A dark green ellipse positioned to the top-left.
2. A lime green shadow (same as the background) strategically placed to **mask** part of the first ellipse.
3. Another dark green ellipse positioned to the top-right.

Together, these create a symmetrical pair of leaf-like shapes on either side of the element.

---

### üîÅ Mirroring the Bottom Half

The `<a>` element mirrors the `<p>` element by applying a vertical flip using `scale: -1`. This reflects the top shapes to the bottom. A different margin is applied to offset the vertical position, aligning the bottom shapes with the top ones.

---

### üß† Techniques Used

* Used just two elements to create a mirrored layout.
* Employed `box-shadow` to simulate multiple shapes from a single element.
* Masked part of the shadow using the same background color to achieve overlapping effects.
* Used `scale: -1` for symmetry without duplicating shape logic.
* Fine-tuned spacing with `margin` to position everything precisely.
