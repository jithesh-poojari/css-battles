## ✅ Code Explanation

This target creates an **optical illusion** using a single triangle that appears mirrored over a vertically split background — **yellow on the left** and **green on the right**.

---

### 🎨 Background

The canvas uses a **linear gradient** set via the universal selector. It splits the screen **vertically** into two equal halves:

* The **left half** is bright yellow (`#F7EC7D`).
* The **right half** is muted green (`#4C6B50`).

This clean vertical split sets the stage for a high-contrast optical effect.

---

### 🔺 Main Shape (`<p>`)

The `<p>` tag is styled as a **tall triangle** using `padding: 30+80`. This creates a tall vertical block, and since there’s no `clip-path`, the triangle effect is a result of the element's shape appearing flipped due to the `scale: -1`.

---

### 🔁 Mirroring Trick

A **nested universal selector** inside the initial `*` applies:

* A `margin: 60`, positioning the triangle downward and slightly in from the top left.
* `scale: -1` flips the element horizontally and vertically, creating the illusion of a mirrored triangle on both sides.

However, because only one element (`<p>`) is used, the illusion is created by **flipping the triangle itself** and aligning it with the split background.

---

### 🧠 Techniques Used

* **Single tag usage** with smart scaling for a mirror illusion.
* **Linear gradient** background for a clean vertical color division.
* **Nested universal selectors** to style all child elements in one go.
* **Compact logic**: Only `margin`, `scale`, and `padding` were needed to recreate the full illusion with just 121 characters — a strong example of CSS Battle efficiency.
