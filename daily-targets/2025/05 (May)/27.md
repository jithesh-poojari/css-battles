## ✅ Code Explanation

This target features a **light blue background** with a central **white hourglass-like shape**, flanked by **two white semi-circular shapes** at the top and bottom, and **two white-outlined blue circles** on the left and right.

The whole thing has a clean, almost symmetric structure — built with just five custom tags: `<p>`, `<a>`, `<b>`, `<d>`, and `<e>`.

---

### 🟦 Background

The universal `*` selector sets:

* A **blue background** using `#5AA4B7`
* All elements to `position: fixed`, so you can place them precisely without worrying about normal flow.

---

### ⬛ Central Pillars (`<p>` and `<b>`)

Both `<p>` and `<b>` are large vertical **white rectangles** with heavy vertical padding to elongate them.

They:

* Use `padding: 30+90` and `90+30` — just swapping values to create visual variation.
* Are placed slightly apart using `margin: 37 52` and `-70 20`, effectively overlapping to form the core “hourglass” shape.
* Use the same light background color `#EBF6F0`.

---

### 🟢 Rounded Top Cap (`<a>`)

The `<a>` tag:

* Sits at the top, forming a **blue semi-circle** that looks like it’s “cut out” of the top of the white center.
* It has a matching `border-radius: 32q 32q 0 0` to round the top corners only.
* Has the same background as the page (`#5AA4B7`) to make it blend in and act as a mask.
* It's positioned with a wide `margin: 0 -60` to cover and cut into the top of the shape.

---

### ⚪ Side Circles (`<d>` and `<e>`)

These are:

* Perfectly circular due to `border-radius: 50%`
* Transparent inside, matching the background (`#5AA4B7`)
* Styled with a thick `border: 32q solid #EBF6F0` to give the white ring look
* Carefully positioned with `margin: -10 30` for the right side (`<d>`) and `margin: -160 -50` for the left (`<e>`), creating visual balance

---

### 🧠 Techniques Used

* **Custom tags** like `<d>` and `<e>` to stay under character limits
* **Padding math** (e.g., `30+90`) to reduce code size
* **Overlapping elements** to create complex shapes without more HTML
* **Border-only circles** for lightweight ring effects
* **Reusing background color** to “cut out” or mask parts of elements (e.g., the top cap)
