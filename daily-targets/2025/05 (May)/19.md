## âœ… Code Explanation

Only `<p><a>` are used â€” again, a minimalistic approach with **two stylable elements** to keep the character count low.

---

### ðŸŽ¨ Background Setup

The first universal selector (`*`) sets the **canvas background color** to a **light mint green** (`#BDE4C1`).

Inside that, a **nested universal selector** applies:

* A **top-half dark-to-red gradient** (`linear-gradient(#4C455B 16.5%, #D95F5B 0)`)
* A **rounded top border** via `border-radius: 60q 60q 0 0`
* A **margin of 60 160 0**, pushing this block down slightly and centering it horizontally

This creates the **top capsule shape**, which acts as the **main half-circle background element** at the top.

---

### ðŸ”º Shared Styles for `<p>` and `<a>`

Both elements:

* Use `position: fixed` for absolute positioning
* Are styled with a **reverse gradient** from **red to dark purple** (`#D95F5B 13.5%, #4C455B 0`)
* Have large `padding: 150+40` (shorthand for 190), giving them a **tall vertical capsule shape**
* Use `margin: -120`, shifting them upward into visible space

This places two tall vertical capsules in the middle of the canvas, stacked or mirrored.

---

### ðŸ”„ Flip and Reposition

* The `<p>` element is **flipped vertically** using `scale: -1`, so its gradient now appears inverted â€” making it look like a **bottom capsule**.
* The `<a>` element is **pushed left and up** with `margin: -150 -280`, separating it from `<p>` and forming a horizontally balanced structure.

---

### ðŸ§  Techniques Used

* **Nested universal selectors** to layer backgrounds with gradients and radius
* **Mirroring** with `scale: -1` to reuse shapes efficiently
* **Fixed positioning and margin tricks** to place shapes precisely
* **Gradient flipping** to simulate opposing capsule ends
* **Reversed color gradients** to create visual contrast

---

### ðŸ§© Final Visual Composition

* A **top capsule** is created using the nested `*` selector, centered at the top.
* The `<p>` and `<a>` elements form **vertical capsules** â€” one mirrored â€” giving the feel of **pill-shaped tubes** aligned vertically.
* Together, the composition looks like a **test-tube style lab setup** with pleasing symmetry.
