## ‚úÖ Code Explanation

This challenge features **five dark blocks** arranged in a symmetric, grid-like pattern over a **light peach background**. The central block is replaced with the same background color to create a hole, giving a "dice face" layout.

---

### üé® Background

The global `*` selector sets the **canvas background** to a soft **peach color** (`#F4DCBF`). This forms the base layer on which other elements are visually built.

Inside a **nested universal selector**, the child element (`<p>`) is styled with a **gray-blue background** (`#556D7F`) and a `margin` that initially positions it roughly in the center.

---

### ‚¨õ Grid of Blocks

The `<p>` tag is styled using `position: fixed` and further adjusted with a new margin to align it precisely in the upper center of the canvas.

The shape's size is controlled with `padding: 10+20`, creating a small rectangular block. The background color is overridden again to `#F4DCBF`, and the `color` is changed (though `color` isn‚Äôt needed here‚Äîit likely just helps save characters for compression quirks).

To **replicate the grid layout**, the `box-shadow` property is used:

* `0 42q #F4DCBF` overlays a lighter square (matching the background) directly beneath the main square to **simulate a gap** or "hole."
* The other shadows ‚Äî `64q 0`, `64q 42q`, `-64q 0`, `-64q 42q` ‚Äî replicate the original block at specific offsets to the left, right, and below. This creates the effect of a **2x3 grid**, with the middle block of the top row left blank via the light-colored shadow.

---

### üß† Techniques Used

* **Nested universal selectors** apply styles to both root and child levels with minimal characters.
* **Box-shadow cloning** efficiently duplicates elements without extra HTML.
* **Negative space simulation** by matching the background color (creates an illusion of removed elements).
* **Single-element replication** is a classic CSS Battle move to reduce markup and character count.

### üèÅ Summary

* **Background**: Light peach (`#F4DCBF`)
* **Shapes**: Five dark squares forming a grid with a central "hole"
* **Effect**: Structured, symmetric dice-face layout
* **Approach**: Smart use of shadows, nesting, and overlapping to minimize characters and markup
* **Score Achieved**: ‚úÖ 100% match using only **196 characters**
