## ✅ Code Explanation

This challenge features **three red quarter circles** placed in a **diagonal arrangement** on a **dark blue-gray background** (`#394257`). The elements give a soft cornered, offset square composition with radial shadows.

---

### 🎨 Background

The global `*` selector sets the **entire canvas** background to `#394257`, a dark desaturated blue-gray. This forms the base upon which the red quarter-circle blocks appear.

---

### 🟥 Red Quarter Circles

Three HTML elements (`<p>`, `<a>`, and `<b>`) are used, all styled similarly to form **quarter circles**.

**How it's done:**

* Each element has:

  * `position: fixed` to allow absolute canvas placement.
  * `padding: 40` to size the square shape.
  * `margin: 52 112` or modified values to position them.
  * `box-shadow: -21q -21q 0 21q #D24444` which is the key trick.

**What the box-shadow does:**

* It creates a red glow offset to the **top-left**, with a **spread of `21q`**, which rounds the corner and creates a **quarter circle**.
* The `padding` makes the element itself invisible (via color blending), and the **shadow becomes the main visual shape**.

---

### 🔁 Placement Strategy

* `<p>`: Placed slightly above center with margin `52 112` – top quarter circle.
* `<a>`: Lowered using `margin: 120 -40` – bottom quarter circle.
* `<b>`: Rotated with `rotate: 90deg` and moved up with `margin: -120 40` – left-side quarter circle.

This creates a triangle-like layout, with quarter circles pointing toward the center from three sides.

---

### 🧠 Techniques Used

* **`box-shadow` as shape renderer**: A clever hack to simulate circular corners with one declaration.
* **Quarter circle via shadow spread and offset**.
* **Multiple fixed-position elements** arranged with precise `margin` values.
* **Minimal HTML**: Only 3 elements used to render all shapes.

---

### 🏁 Summary

* **Background**: `#394257` (dark blue-gray)
* **Shapes**: Three red quarter circles (`#D24444`) made with shadow tricks
* **Effect**: Dynamic, offset, radial pattern
* **Approach**: Box-shadow for shape creation, rotate and margin for layout
* **Score Achieved**: ✅ 100% match with just **162 characters**
