## ‚úÖ Code Explanation

This challenge forms **two red rectangles** (pillars) stacked vertically on a **yellow background**, with a **gap between them**, creating a bold, minimalistic geometric look.

---

### üé® Background

The entire canvas uses a **warm yellow** (`#FADE8B`), applied globally using the `*` selector. This serves as the foundation color for the design.

---

### üü• Vertical Pillars

A single `<p>` element is used, and its background is changed using a sibling selector (`+*`) in the `*` rule. This applies a **red fill** (`#D24444`) along with `margin: 40 145`, placing the red block horizontally centered.

To **create the second (lower) red rectangle**, the code uses a `box-shadow`:

* `box-shadow: 0 95q #FADE8B` draws a rectangle directly **below** the original one, but in the **same yellow as the background**.
* This overlays a yellow block between the two red ones, **creating a clean gap** ‚Äî even though only **one red element** exists in the HTML.

---

### üß† Techniques Used

* **Sibling selector `+*`** applies styles to the first HTML element after `<style>`, saving characters and avoiding class or tag selectors.
* **`box-shadow` for masking** ‚Äî applying the background color strategically to "erase" a portion of the shape, giving the illusion of a gap.
* **Efficient layout** using fixed positioning and carefully calculated margin and padding to center everything accurately.
* Achieving **multiple shapes from one element** is a classic CSS Battle trick, key to hitting low character counts.

### üèÅ Summary

* **Background**: Yellow (`#FADE8B`)
* **Shapes**: Two red vertical rectangles with a clean gap between
* **Effect**: Minimalist, symmetrical split-bar look
* **Approach**: Use of box-shadow to mask part of the block and simulate separation
* **Score Achieved**: ‚úÖ 100% match using only **133 characters**
