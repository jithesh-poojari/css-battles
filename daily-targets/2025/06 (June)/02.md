## ✅ Code Explanation

This target showcases a **single circular ring** with a **salmon-red center** and a **light gray outer stroke**, set against a **dark blue background**. The illusion of the ring is achieved using a mix of `border`, `outline`, and clever positioning with minimal markup.

---

### 🎨 Background Setup

The universal selector (`*`) sets the **entire canvas background** to a dark blue using the color `#23384B`.

Then, using the adjacent sibling selector (`+*`), it targets the element **after** the `<style>` tag — in this case, the `<p>` — and applies:

* A `border` of `22q` solid with color `#D36354` (salmon-red)
* An `outline` of `22q` solid with color `#D9D9D9` (light gray)
* A `margin` of `100 150` to position it centrally
* `border-radius: 50%` to make the shape perfectly circular

This stacking of a `border` inside an `outline` produces the **ring effect** — red on the inside, gray on the outside.

---

### 🧱 Shape Construction

The `<p>` tag is the only visible HTML element and is styled with:

* `position: fixed` to keep it anchored precisely
* `padding: 50 + 15` (which evaluates to `65`) to determine the size of the circle
* `margin: 15` to nudge it slightly and balance centering

The `padding` helps define the internal size of the circle, while the border and outline add visual weight on both sides.

---

### 🧠 Techniques Used

* **Adjacent sibling selector (`+*`)** is used cleverly to apply styles to `<p>` without selecting it directly
* **Outline + Border combo** forms a double-ring with contrasting colors, mimicking a donut-like shape
* **Single element strategy** keeps the character count low and structure minimal
* **CSS math** in padding (`50+15`) is interpreted as shorthand for `65`, saving characters

---

### 🏁 Summary

* Only one visible element is used (`<p>`)
* Styling relies on border and outline layering for depth
* Shape is perfectly centered with `margin` and `padding`
* Efficient use of CSS selectors and shorthand to hit a high score with just 156 characters
