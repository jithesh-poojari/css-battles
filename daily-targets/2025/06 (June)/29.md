## ‚úÖ Code Explanation

This challenge presents a visually balanced design featuring a **vertically split background** ‚Äî yellow on the left and red on the right. At the center, there's a **horizontal pill-shaped capsule** with two distinct colors: green on the left and dark blue on the right. On either end of this capsule are **white circular caps**, giving the design a polished, symmetrical look.

---

### üé® Background

The background is created using a **linear gradient that splits the canvas vertically**. The left half is filled with a soft yellow (`#FADE8B`) and the right half with red (`#D24444`). The gradient direction is set to go from right to left to achieve this split with minimal characters.

---

### üü© Capsule Body

The horizontal capsule in the center is made with a tall and wide rectangle styled to appear pill-shaped. This shape uses another **linear gradient**, splitting the capsule's background color horizontally into green on the left (`#48BF7D`) and dark blue on the right (`#394257`). Padding is used to give it a thick, rounded shape, and it is centered on the screen using fixed positioning and carefully tuned negative margins.

---

### ‚ö™ End Caps

The white circles at each end of the capsule are created using a clever combination of a base circle and a `box-shadow`. One element is used to place a white circle at the left end, and its box-shadow duplicates the same circle at the right end. This trick helps keep the HTML minimal while achieving the mirrored cap effect.

A secondary element is included with slightly adjusted margins to help align everything precisely ‚Äî likely for sub-pixel accuracy required for a perfect match in CSS Battle.

---

### üß† Techniques Used

* **Gradient backgrounds** are used both for the canvas and for coloring the pill horizontally, allowing two-tone color schemes with no extra elements.
* **Box-shadow cloning** is used to duplicate the white end caps with one element.
* **Padding and border-radius** create soft, pill-like shapes.
* **Fixed positioning and margin tuning** are used for exact alignment and centering.

---

### üèÅ Summary

* The background is a vertical split of yellow and red.
* The central capsule is horizontally split into green and dark blue.
* Two white end caps complete the pill design with a clean, symmetric look.
* The layout is accomplished using gradients, box-shadow tricks, and precise placement.
* Achieved a perfect match with only 287 characters ‚Äî efficient and elegant.
