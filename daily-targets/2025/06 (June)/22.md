## ✅ Code Explanation

This challenge displays a **diamond with a notch and a vertical pill** stacked at the center over a **green background**, giving it a modern, abstract look.

---

### 🎨 Background

The canvas is filled with a **green color** (`#48BF7D`) using the global universal selector. This sets the base for all the shapes to appear on.

---

### 🔷 Center Diamond

The `<p>` element creates a **dark blue diamond**:

* It uses a `padding: 35` to form a square.
* It is rotated using `rotate: 45deg`, converting it into a diamond shape.
* Positioned at the center with `margin: 107 157`.
* The background is set to **#394257**, a dark blue-gray tone.

---

### 🔲 Center Rounded Pill

The `<a>` element forms a **short vertical pill** placed above the diamond:

* It has smaller `padding: 20` and a `border-radius: 10q` for rounded edges.
* It's centered using the same horizontal margin but shifted upward with `margin: -40 0`.

---

### 🔺 Bottom Triangle Cut

The `<b>` element creates a **dark triangle** to simulate a notch on the diamond:

* It uses the same background as `<p>`, maintaining a unified color scheme.
* Positioned slightly lower and to the left with `margin: -33 -37`.
* It uses a `clip-path: polygon(100% 0, 0 0, 100% 100%)` to make a right-angled triangle, appearing as a sharp overlay at the bottom-left of the diamond.

---

### 🧠 Techniques Used

* **Fixed positioning** allows exact placement of each shape.
* **Transform rotation** helps turn a square into a diamond using fewer characters.
* **Clip-path** efficiently creates a triangle shape without extra elements.
* **Layering and offsets** make the layout clean and centered.

---

### 🏁 Summary

* **Background**: Green (`#48BF7D`)
* **Shapes**: One diamond, one triangle, and one vertical pill
* **Effect**: Abstract layered composition with central focus
* **Approach**: Rotation, clipping, and minimal markup with well-placed styling
* **Score Achieved**: ✅ 100% match using only **219 characters**
