## ✅ Code Explanation

This challenge creates a visual of **two black circular borders** overlapping horizontally on a **green background**, with carefully placed **green cutouts** to separate and balance the composition. The final look resembles a dumbbell or binoculars.

---

### 🎨 Background and Global Setup

All elements are given a **fixed position** to anchor them precisely. The background is set to a **green color** (`#5A9F48`). This also serves as the color for the cutouts.

---

### ⚫ Black Circles

Two large black circles are drawn using the `<p>` and `<a>` elements. Both use:

* A **border** of `32q` in **dark gray-black** (`#282828`)
* `border-radius: 50%` to make them perfectly round
* `padding: 100` to define their size
* The `<p>` is slightly centered, while the `<a>` is shifted left and up using margin tweaks, which causes them to overlap and form the binocular/dumbbell shape.

---

### 🟩 Green Cutouts

Two more elements, `<b>` and `<c>`, are used to **mask parts of the black circles** with the same green as the background:

* `<b>` uses a large **left-side box-shadow** that extends and covers the left edge of the left circle.
* `<c>` is placed at the center to create a visual separation between the two circles.

This clever reuse of the background color **erases** the connecting middle, making it appear like two distinct circles rather than one blob.

---

### 🧠 Techniques Used

* **Fixed positioning** across all elements gives full control over layout.
* **Border with radius** creates perfect circles without needing images.
* **Overlaying with background-colored elements** creates cutout effects without needing `clip-path`.
* **Box-shadow** is used as a shape generation tool rather than for lighting, helping save characters.
* Minimal elements and smart CSS math (`padding: 99+50`) reduce character count.

---

### 🏁 Summary

* **Background**: Green
* **Main Shapes**: Two black bordered circles (`<p>` and `<a>`)
* **Cutouts**: Green overlays (`<b>` and `<c>`) to divide and shape
* **Result**: Clean and balanced “binocular” or dumbbell-like figure
* **Score Achieved**: 100% match with only 216 characters
