### **Code Explanation**
It looks like you've pasted the explanation from the previous challenge. Here’s the corrected breakdown for **CSS Battle Daily Target: 28/03/2025** based on the provided code.

#### **Background (`*` selector)**  
- `background:#00B0C8;` sets the page background to a bright cyan shade.
- `+*{}` applies styles to the next sibling of `*`, which doesn't work as intended because `*` selects all elements, and direct sibling selection isn't valid here.
- Inside the `+*` block:
  - `background:#FFF;` sets the next sibling’s background to white.
  - `border:20px solid#1A353C;` adds a thick dark teal border.
  - `margin:80 130;` attempts to position the element, though it lacks explicit directions (`top, left, etc.`).

#### **Main Shape (`p` element)**  
- `position:fixed;` ensures it remains fixed in place.
- `background:#FFF;` makes it white.
- `padding:10+150;` (Invalid CSS syntax, as arithmetic isn't supported in plain CSS).
- `margin:40-100;` (Also invalid due to incorrect arithmetic).
